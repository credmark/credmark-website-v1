Swap Drops happened in two phases: first CMK was swapped for USDC, then dropping CMK to create concentrated liquidity within a certain price range. The swap allows us to collect USDC to reduce downside movement and the drop to reduce slippage in that range while allowing our community to become tokenholders without contending with rapid price fluctuations caused by speculators. Swap drops were done every 2 hours for 3 days."}],"markDefs":[],"style":"normal"},{"_key":"ff57632cafc2","_type":"block","children":[{"_key":"a398ff5b54e20","_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"You can read about our IDO plan in detail "},{"_key":"a398ff5b54e21","_type":"span","marks":["05896ecd1508"],"text":"here"},{"_key":"a398ff5b54e22","_type":"span","marks":[],"text":", but the focus of this article is what we learned during the execution of the IDO, including where we adjusted the plan to meet real world conditions and considerations for other projects considering this approach."}],"markDefs":[{"_key":"05896ecd1508","_type":"link","href":"https://www.credmark.com/blog/liquidity-swap-drop"}],"style":"normal"},{"_key":"9cbd8581a359","_type":"block","children":[{"_key":"05b5c06c5d93","_type":"span","marks":["strong"],"text":"ECONOMICS & TRADING"}],"markDefs":[],"style":"h2"},{"_key":"c3a3bfa4ae09","_type":"block","children":[{"_key":"2e9edda50312","_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"Credmark’s IDO strategy was incredibly successful in building a stabilized asset.

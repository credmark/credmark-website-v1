What does risk mean in the context of Defi?</h1><p>It’s like a gold rush in a Wild West, ample opportunity under the risk of those who are in power to get away with it. I will be working with quants and AI/ML engineers to equate the power distribution between ordinary people and institutional players by better tooling for the former.</p><p>Basically giving away bazookas to the villagers.</p><p></p><h1>Why Am I Qualified for this Role?</h1><p>I have fifteen years of experience across various roles in financial markets. I know its infrastructure, participants, their perspectives, products, and their behavior.</p><p>My previous assignment was to assist a sizable institutional bank in improving quant team capabilities and transform technical value proposition. It resulted in a fifty percent reduction in specialists onboarding and traders’ effort waste.</p><p></p><h1>Why Am I Joining Credmark?</h1><p>Some might think this was crazy to change an established career path. I’m not a conventional person, so for me, it’s logical, and here is why.</p><ul><li>Firstly, I have a passion for innovation and impact. Having experience in traditional finance, knowing its good and not so good sides, and how it could be improved makes sense to join a start-up. From scratch, you can create the best and focus on a real value-add without dealing with legacy. I would like to bring everyone on this journey, my team, other colleagues at Credmark, investors, and even members of our community.</li><li>Secondly, Credmark has a powerful vision of bringing data and risk analytics DAO to the public. This is a strong value proposition for ordinary people, tired of the traditional finance system and stepping into the world of Defi. Providing value to the community is one of the core values I always had and who could imagine that it also could be your full-time work.</li></ul><p></p><h1>What does Success Look Like?</h1><p>In the short run, it is CMK users recommending our data and tooling to their friends.</p><p>In the long run, ensuring we have robust model validation, approval, and review governance, also operating autonomously.</p><p>Poor performance is the opposite.</p></div><div class="flex"><p class="font-bold pt-10 pb-5 px-5 md:px-20"><img width="40" class="float-left pt-0 pr-5" src="../assets/arrow.svg"/>Back to blog</p></div></div></div></main></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"post":{"author":"Asan Tulemis","content":[{"_key":"2c00ab17d895","_type":"block","children":[{"_key":"1ef8d9b02fcf","_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"My name is Asan Tulemis and I am thrilled to be joining Credmark as their Head of Risk Solutions.

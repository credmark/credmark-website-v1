The liquidator pays back the loan, and collects that value of the loan plus the liquidation penalty. This penalty ranges from 5% — 8% of the value of the loan.

If the economic incentive goes away, so does the enforcement.</p><p>When ETH goes down in value, the LTV of a debt position goes up. Falling prices exacerbate the high borrowing interest rate and gas fees.</p><p>If the gas prices to liquidate that position are higher than the liquidation penalty, the liquidator loses money. Since most DeFi platforms only allow you to liquidate 50% of a position at a time, the liquidation penalty rewards are at max 2.5% of the value of the debt. In the case of $100 gas fees, that means that only debt positions higher than $4000 are profitable to even liquidate, and the under-collateralized loans under that amount generate interest, locking value in the protocol until they become profitable again, and further exacerbating the debt to liquidity ratio.</p><h3>- 4 -BAD ACTORS TAKE ADVANTAGE OF FUD</h3><p>Exploits are creative and unpredictable, but often take advantage of market sentiment. In high utilization times, these problems can be artificially exacerbated.</p><p>In the case of a high profile user being unable to withdraw or borrow funds, it’s likely that the price of the DeFi tokens would suffer. Since shorts can be profitable for market manipulators, it’s not unfeasible that someone could use these dynamics to push a protocol to the brink in order to enrich themselves by shorting it. This could create a crisis of confidence due to limited liquidity.</p><h4>BE BRAVE, BE SMART</h4><p>DeFi investing has always had these risks, and has endured the incredible volatility that Crypto provides, but risk is just one of the many features that make DeFi as dynamic as it is today. Be smart with your investments, don’t put in more than you’d be able to absorb if things go south, and have fun becoming the future of finance.</p></div><div class="flex"><p class="font-bold pt-10 pb-5 px-5 md:px-20"><img width="40" class="float-left pt-0 pr-5" src="../assets/arrow.svg"/>Back to blog</p></div></div></div></main></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"post":{"author":" Neil Zumwalde","content":[{"_key":"974c4cb0f3e6","_type":"block","children":[{"_key":"d24e7f418c5c","_type":"span","marks":["strong","em"],"text":"Note: This piece uses Aave as an example, but these dynamics apply to DeFi widely."}],"markDefs":[],"style":"normal"},{"_key":"7f9b207f3b17","_type":"block","children":[{"_key":"566e5b6485950","_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"DeFi is a no-brainer."}],"markDefs":[],"style":"normal"},{"_key":"767b33a563a5","_type":"block","children":[{"_key":"1aa22e3d70cf0","_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"Suddenly the same mechanisms that institutions use to make money are available to anyone with a computer and a small stack of cryptocurrencies.

It requires a robust, engaged community that thoroughly understands the subject matter, one that makes meaningful contributions. For some projects, this only extends to voting on how and where to modify incentives and rules. What Credmark is building goes a step further; a fully composable risk modeling platform that incentivizes not only governance, but also contribution. But there is an elephant in the room: risk management is complex, and not something most DeFi users think a lot about. Sure, it’s absolutely a requirement for the growth of the industry, but how do we get the ball rolling?"}],"markDefs":[],"style":"normal"},{"_key":"8bc66d608849","_type":"block","children":[{"_key":"88a178939244","_type":"span","marks":[],"text":""}],"markDefs":[],"style":"normal"},{"_key":"5b6619004a44","_type":"block","children":[{"_key":"fe613f77ab740","_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"To that we answer: THE CREDMARK RISK LIBRARY."}],"markDefs":[],"style":"normal"},{"_key":"48ea258fa622","_type":"block","children":[{"_key":"20b03ed4edd7","_type":"span","marks":[],"text":""}],"markDefs":[],"style":"normal"},{"_key":"5174cbf7bd21","_type":"block","children":[{"_key":"3e5524b1bd860","_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"We are kicking off this initiative by publishing content that applies both qualitative and quantitative assessments to DeFi.

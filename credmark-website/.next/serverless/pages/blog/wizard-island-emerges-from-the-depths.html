This is an ambitious process and is not something that can happen overnight.

This also splits up liquidity such that our community benefits as well from the growth of CMK.</p><p><strong>What is Alchemist?</strong></p><p>Alchemist began as a project that bootstrapped their funding through community engagement and now is one of the most vibrant crypto communities in the industry. The project has launched 3 products aimed at improving the user experience on DeFi.</p><p>Those projects are:</p><p>mistX: A Flashbots powered DEX that protects users from MEV. <a href="https://app.mistx.io/#/exchange">https://app.mistx.io/#/exchange</a></p><p>Copper: an open transparent, and user-friendly way to participate in a Fair Launch Auction (FLA) <a href="https://copperlaunch.com/">https://copperlaunch.com/</a></p><p>And last but not least, the Crucible Rewards program, which is the piece of technology that we have integrated with in order to run liquidity mining rewards.</p><p><strong>So What is a Crucible?</strong></p><p>For many projects, when you subscribe to their incentive programs this means sending your crypto to a smart contract. As <a href="https://twitter.com/thegostep">thegostep</a> stated in a recent blog post, Not your keys, not your crypto.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/ampleforth/5-lessons-learned-in-liquidity-mining-f905c4842387">https://medium.com/ampleforth/5-lessons-learned-in-liquidity-mining-f905c4842387</a></p><p>Alchemist came up with a novel solution that is a fork of the Ampleforth geyser program, launched in the summer of 2020<strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>The innovation?</strong></p><p>Using an ERC 721 token as a wallet to store your ERC 20 tokens (in this case your CMK- ETH SUSHI LP tokens). This is what Alchemist calls a Crucible. Users essentially wrap their ERC 20s in an ERC 721 that is kept in the users wallet, giving them complete custody of their assets. The crucible can then be “subscribed” to various rewards programs offered on the Alchemist platform.</p><p><strong>Why is an ERC 721 Needed?</strong></p><p>An <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721">ERC 721</a> is a non-fungible token standard created in 2018.</p><p>“Non-fungible” means “unique” unlike a standard token which shares the same token address, an NFT has it’s own unique address.</p><p>NFTs are a direct contrast to coins:</p><ul><li>Coins: 1⚗️ is 1⚗️, they have equivalent value and use</li><li>NFTs: a Crucible NFT is not equal to another Crucible NFT and it is very unlikely that any two Crucibles have equivalent value</li></ul><p>Crucibles are stored in an Ethereum wallet and can be used as a smart wallet for other ERC20 tokens, like the aforementioned Sushiswap Liquidity Provision tokens (SLP’s).</p><p>This gives two immediate benefits;</p><ol><li>Separate asset management between Crucibles while maintaining a single wallet</li><li>The ability to transfer your Crucible with the contained assets between wallets in a single transaction.</li></ol><p>Users who Liquidity Provide (LP) into the CMK-ETH sushi pool receive back a quantity of ERC 20 tokens that represent their share of the pool.</p><p>So understanding that a Crucible is able to hold ERC20 tokens, this also opens the possibility to store LP tokens within a Crucible as well. LP tokens are commonly used to participate in staking programs and earn some form of rewards. Taking part in these staking programs would usually mean transferring custody/ownership of your tokens in order to accrue rewards.</p><p><strong>How Am I Retaining Custody of My Assets if they are being subscribed?</strong></p><p>Once the Crucible is subscribed to a rewards program, the ERC 20 tokens contained within are placed in a vault. The Crucible acts as the key that allows for the withdrawal of those assets from the Crucible program, thus no matter what happens, whoever owns the crucible owns the pledged assets in the vault.</p><p><strong>What Happens If There is a Hack?</strong></p><p>The only assets that are at risk are the yet to be distributed CMK tokens allocated to the Crucible reward program. No user funds are at risk, as in order for the bad actor to steal user funds, they would have to gain access to each individual private key to each individual wallet of each individual subscribed crucible. A tall task.</p><p>It is worth noting that neither the original Ampleforth geyser contract nor the Alchemist crucible have experienced a security breach since their inception over 12 months ago. Ampleforth has since replaced its original geyser program with the Alchemist Crucible program. The other projects currently using the Crucible program are: Alchemist, MASQ and Ampleforth.</p><p><strong>Why Did We Choose Alchemist? Why Didn’t We Just Build Something Ourselves?</strong></p><figure><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/9y1au457/production/448a2b0bcd3dc6b6686b2beb6167bed39c019d07-875x492.jpg"/></figure><p>Firstly, we wanted to bootstrap liquidity on Sushiswap as soon as possible. This helps Credmark in a variety of ways, as the more liquidity there is spread to multiple LP’s, the more confidence people have in buying it.</p><p>By offering rewards to CMK/ETH SLP holders who have provided liquidity to our Sushiswap pool, we are incentivizing users to create a healthy, diverse, and liquid market for CMK.</p><p>1. This is good for the protocol because it increases the amount of liquidity being provided by entities besides us and locks it in for a pre.</p><p>2. The people providing liquidity are inevitably subjected to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XJ1MSTEuU0">Impermanent Loss</a> (IL), this program allows for LPs on CMK to recoup that loss, and thus hedge out IL. Keep in mind that LPs continue to receive the fees generated by the pool itself.</p><p>Secondly, building out our Liquidity Mining program would require a ton of work. This would mean devoting a ton of internal resources to building something that isn’t integral to Credmark. Additionally, we would need to have the contract audited by several firms before we were comfortable asking users to interact with it. This entire process would likely take months.</p><p>By using Alchemist we are able to launch a rewards program in an extremely timely fashion without having to worry about building anything internally ourselves. We believe that the noncustodial nature of the Crucible program is also in the best interests of our users and we are ideologically aligned with the Alchemist ecosystem.</p><p><strong>What is “Wizard Island v1”?</strong></p><p>Rewards begin on Sept 8th 8:00 PM UTC. We’re supplying 150,000 CMK by releasing 15k every week. You’ll get a 3x multiplier on your rewards after holding strong in the pool for 30 days.</p><figure><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/9y1au457/production/69f5b0fa0425cbedbf9e2c2a9a4ac815682c9f96-1920x1080.jpg"/></figure><p>Starting September 8th, Here is How You Create a Crucible and Subscribe to the Program:</p><ol><li>If you don’t already own CMK or ETH, purchase both <a href="https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?inputCurrency=0x68cfb82eacb9f198d508b514d898a403c449533e&amp;outputCurrency=0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48">HERE</a> and <a href="https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap">HERE</a></li><li>LP into the CMK-ETH pool on Sushiswap, which you can make <a href="https://sushiswap.vision/pair/0x3349217670f9aa55c5640a2b3d806654d27d0569">HERE</a>.

This will allow you to hedge out IL.</li></ol><p>You then can mint a Crucible, Alchemist’s (<a href="https://crucible.alchemist.wtf/">instructions here</a>), and deposit your CMK/ETH SLP tokens into it to get proportional rewards.</p><p>As this program continues and as both Alchemist and Credmark progress as projects, we’ll be taking notes and plan on announcing new rewards programs as Wizard Island v1 winds down.</p><p>We’ll be releasing content on how to mint crucibles and participate in rewards programs in addition to the ample material the Alchemist team has provided. Both <a href="https://discord.gg/BJbYSRDdtr">our</a> discord server and the <a href="https://discord.gg/Pdfhf393U2">Alchemist</a> server are great places to engage with the team directly and learn more about each of our projects. Leading up to the beginning of our rewards program we’ll host a joint AMA to address questions from both communities.</p><p>Finally, we’ll be announcing a design competition tomorrow for the creatives out there to potentially earn rewards of all kinds!</p><p>The next 6 months are going to be a sprint as this the first of MANY exciting things happening here at Credmark.</p><p>Stay tuned.</p></div><div class="flex"><p class="font-bold pt-10 pb-5 px-5 md:px-20"><img width="40" class="float-left pt-0 pr-5" src="../assets/arrow.svg"/>Back to blog</p></div></div></div></main></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"post":{"author":"Momin Ahmad","content":[{"_key":"28cda2baca0f","_type":"block","children":[{"_key":"03d844724a3b","_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"On September 8th, 2021 Credmark’s Wizard Island, a liquidity mining rewards program will go live via Crucible, a product from the Alchemist team."}],"markDefs":[],"style":"normal"},{"_key":"d2e439c37dff","_type":"block","children":[{"_key":"399704381b770","_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"I’m sure you have a lot of questions."}],"markDefs":[],"style":"normal"},{"_key":"10afa1765054","_type":"block","children":[{"_key":"27d1f655ac1a0","_type":"span","marks":["strong"],"text":"Why are we doing this?"}],"markDefs":[],"style":"normal"},{"_key":"5cebb56c64d1","_type":"block","children":[{"_key":"205efdc079c80","_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"We set out to make Credmark into distributed risk modeling platforms where developers stake CMK in order to build models and governance voters stake CMK in order to incentivize the most in demand models.

Lending protocols are a logical starting point for examining risk because Yield Farming Apps and other DeFi protocols are built on top of them and thus inherit their risksThe output is a risk report applying standard TradFi tools to both protocols. Our strategy is to leverage existing institutional banking tools to establish a quantitative base for idiosyncratic and comparative analysis. DeFi specific tools will come down the line, but because the industry is so new, and available risk tooling so scarce, it would be impossible to create a comprehensive toolset or assessment from the jump.

Our mission is not to create a for-profit entity, but rather to build a Distributed Autonomous Organization. For that reason, we ask our research partners to pick up and hold CMK- doing so aligns incentives and makes them part of our community.

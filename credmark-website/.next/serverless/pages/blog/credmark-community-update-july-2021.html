If that’s you, welcome back! Here’s what happened.</p><p>From June 15th to June 18th we ran a public sale of our CMK utility/governance token. We did this by making CMK available on Uniswap so that anyone could swap CMK.</p><p>We were the first project to run an IDO on Uniswap v3 (full post-mortem <a href="https://www.credmark.com/blog/a-retrospective-on-our-ido">here</a>), which makes us either crazy or courageous. Or maybe both.</p><p>We designed the IDO with one primary goal: make CMK available to our community, to make sure that early users have a strong voice in our development and decentralization process. We publicized how we were planning on reaching this goal in <a href="https://www.credmark.com/blog/liquidity-swap-drop">this post</a>. Unfortunately, some participants hadn’t read it and were surprised that we were more focused on protecting downside than mooning.</p><p>Was that good for the community?</p><p>Definitely. Not only were you, the community, able to afford enough tokens to have your voices heard, but the token price stayed steady throughout and immediately following the three day IDO, a time where many other projects lost huge amounts of value.</p><h3>PLATFORM</h3><p>In June we <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdhnSPuS9eQ">announced</a> our first product: the Uniswap SmartPool. We <em>love </em>Uniswap — did you know we ran our IDO on Uniswap?! 😉 — but we understand how difficult it can be to setup or add liquidity. Our first product simplifies the process by relying on custom-built risk models to automatically add liquidity in line with the user’s risk tolerance.</p><p>The Uniswap SmartPool is a great example of the kinds of applications that can be built on the Credmark platform, using publicly available data to model and tailor a user’s experience specifically to their risk tolerance.</p><h3><br/>TEAM</h3><p>In June our already rock-solid team was further fortified by the addition of our very own superstar CTO, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/emilieyeager/">Emilie Yeager</a>. With 20 years of experience in devops, product management, and technical infrastructure, Emilie is easily the best candidate we could have hoped for for this position.

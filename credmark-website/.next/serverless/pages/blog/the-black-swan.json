For this issue, the role of exchanges and OTC desks in crypto lending is becoming harder and harder to ignore. We’re seeing volumes increase on DEXes like dYdX and nüo, on centralized exchanges, like Bitmex and Coinbase, and even across OTC desks. Many protocols in DeFi have reported that over ⅔’s of their “borrow” volume comes from margin trading which has balanced out the previously disproportionate ratio between suppliers and borrowers. Similarly, firms such as Cryptolend and Templar Fund have built up fairly large AUM by giving their users returns on their crypto. This is accomplished by lending funds to exchanges like Bitfinex, BitMEX and Poloniex for margin trading (in the case of Cryptolend) or performing market making trades (in the case of Templar Fund)."}],"markDefs":[],"style":"normal"},{"_key":"9912e85a70f0","_type":"block","children":[{"_key":"6d15eb42f9490","_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"Firms like BlockFi, Nexo, Cred and Celsius jumped into the institutional lending market in late 2018 / early 2019. All 4 firms demonstrated massive success in the consumer lending and quasi-banking realm. Yet clearly the returns, whether due to volume or quantity, were not enough to keep up the high growth rates expected or consistently provide their customers returns. The tremendous volume in the institutional world presents the perfect opportunity to increase the size of their loan books as well as generate interest that can be paid back to lenders. Many, if not all, of these loans are made to provide liquidity to execute massive, market making trades."}],"markDefs":[],"style":"normal"},{"_key":"c1494621ce47","_type":"block","children":[{"_key":"eafbd610ce5a0","_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"So why does this matter in context of this report?"}],"markDefs":[],"style":"normal"},{"_key":"5ca45c86f4da","_type":"block","children":[{"_key":"e21e492de5760","_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"In traditional finance, credit can be assessed by evaluating the successful repayment of a loan, and the use of the loan comes into play when dictating terms. Whether it be a credit card, a small business loan, a car or a house, the diversification of one’s credit history has a large impact on their ability to access credit in the future, but crypto lending does not have this diversification. While there are cases of crypto loans for traditional use cases (cars, houses, businesses) the majority of loans are used to speculate. A common practice is to use a volatile asset, like ETH or BTC, as collateral against a fiat or stablecoin loan. This is then used to further go long on ETH or BTC on an exchange. Many sophisticated traders will only go 2x leverage while others will take huge risks at much higher leverage. History shows that the sophisticated trader generally makes out better and is clearly a better candidate as far as credit is concerned, but this behavior goes unnoticed by most. Crypto exchanges boast some of the most sophisticated liquidation algorithms designed specifically to manage risk associated with margin trading. Yet, these algorithms are still dependent upon a segment of users behaving rationally and managing their own risk with responsible amounts of leverage. If every trader used 100x leverage and the price falls too sharply, there would be hell to pay."}],"markDefs":[],"style":"normal"},{"_key":"3c1cba9e223c","_type":"block","children":[{"_key":"16c2b9ce44ae0","_type":"span","marks":["strong","em"],"text":"*This might be the most important point I made.

The exchange is an instrumental tool in regards to price discovery and has allowed crypto currency to become a viable financial instrument over the last 10 years.

Otherwise, the health of the entire crypto industry will be beholden to the whales who have shown the ability to manipulate BTC price to benefit them whenever necessary.

Transparency of held assets is also crucial to maintain trust amongst the industry. Institutions invest across a diverse range of markets, not just digital assets. Transparency of those positions is paramount for a healthy crypto market.

DeFi is only 2 years old and every day seems to spawn new and creative ideas that will allow less privileged people to enjoy the promises of DeFi. An example is the EOS REX protocol. Built on the EOS blockchain, the REX token allows users to borrow and lend their CPU/NET bandwidth. Developers with great ideas but who lack the necessary hardware requirements can leverage this ecosystem to test their ideas.

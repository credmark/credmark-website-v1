While there are cases of crypto loans for traditional use cases (cars, houses, businesses) the majority of loans are used to speculate. A common practice is to use a volatile asset, like ETH or BTC, as collateral against a fiat or stablecoin loan. This is then used to further go long on ETH or BTC on an exchange. Many sophisticated traders will only go 2x leverage while others will take huge risks at much higher leverage. History shows that the sophisticated trader generally makes out better and is clearly a better candidate as far as credit is concerned, but this behavior goes unnoticed by most. Crypto exchanges boast some of the most sophisticated liquidation algorithms designed specifically to manage risk associated with margin trading.

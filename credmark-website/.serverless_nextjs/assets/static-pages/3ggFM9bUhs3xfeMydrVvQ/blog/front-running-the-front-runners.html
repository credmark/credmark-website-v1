There are <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/ethermine-adds-front-running-software-to-help-miners-offset-eip-1559-revenue-losses">rumblings</a> that miners will begin turning to MEV software in order to make up for lost transaction fees. While the true effects of the upcoming layer 1 proposals are heavily debated, the current environment clearly presents risk in regards to MEV.

It’s not unreasonable for them to expect that tools, services and infrastructure they are using have considered and mitigated the risk that is unique to blockchain based money markets.</p><p>There are a wide variety of solutions that have been proposed at both the layer 1 level and application level. Layer 1 solutions include the upcoming <a href="https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/ethereum-improvement-proposal-ETH-gas-fee">EIP 1559</a> proposal decision and further down the line, the Berlin Fork and switch to Eth 2.0, and Proof of Stake. In the present, platforms use a variety of different techniques to mitigate MEV/front-running attacks. 0x, Curve finance, Dexible, Enigma and many other solutions currently exist and are constantly being innovated. With each solution, come many flaws, and each of those flaws offers its own unique type of risk.</p><p>So where does this leave us? Solutions at every level of the ecosystem have been implemented and presented, yet their true effectiveness might not be realized for some time. Meanwhile, MEV is growing at an alarming rate and could potentially have a real impact on user returns. Until there is a silver bullet at the layer 1 level, platforms and protocols should be partially evaluated based on the measures they take to shield their users from MEV style attacks. Another solution is anti-MEV models could be opened up to a larger community of DeFi devs/users/researchers. Model builders and models could gather insight and improvements from a user group that is incentivized to improve these models in order to shield users from malicious behavior.<br/></p></div></div></div></main><div><div class="block m-auto"><div class="hidden sm:flex space-x-4 justify-center pb-1.5"><a class="pt-3.5 pl-20 text-xs" href="mailto:info@credmark.com" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"> info@credmark.com </a><a href="https://discord.com/invite/3dSfMqP3d4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><img width="25" src="../assets/discordsingle.png" alt="Discord logo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"/></a><a href="https://t.me/credmark" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><img width="25" src="../assets/telegram.png" alt="Telegram logo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"/></a><a href="https://twitter.com/credmarkhq " target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><img width="25" src="../assets/twitter.png" alt="Twitter logo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"/></a><p class="block m-auto text-center text-xs">© 2021 Credmark.

If effectively architected, this can ensure CMK, in its nascency, can be strongly correlated with a more established and stable asset (USDC). This provides reliability for the community of long-term project contributors. This is why we’re launching Credmark’s token CMK as an LSD, a Liquidity Swap Drop.</p><p><strong>By the end of the IDO we will have accurate price discovery, medium-term price support, wide distribution and minimal front-running with low upfront costs.</strong></p><h2>CMK</h2><figure><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/9y1au457/production/5cf13cd074ffeee716a62573127d2ea8b389ebe5-1688x1254.png"/></figure><p>CMK is a limited supply asset, with distribution approaching 100M tokens over the lifetime of the project. The initial circulating supply will include only the Public Distribution Event. The other tranches will vest or distribute as follows:</p><figure><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/9y1au457/production/fbdd5ba148a9769d56fd992b9434d24890f35773-981x353.jpg"/></figure><h3><strong>UNISWAP V3</strong></h3><p>Uniswap v3 is a complex platform for liquidity providers, while being relatively simple for swap users. Their recent update allows for seamless public launches for token projects without necessarily massive initial capital on the part of the project.</p><p>The ability to swap in more of the tokens on a schedule gives downward pressure, a necessary component of price discovery. The liquidity ranges allow the asset price to move, but diminish volatility by progressively shrinking the successive liquidity rangesThe constricting price pressure allows speculators to set the price, and for standard community members to reliably avoid being dumped on.</p><figure><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/9y1au457/production/5438aa93ab45f97c9925e007541d99816dbb0e83-786x1999.jpg"/></figure><p><strong>How do we do this mechanically?</strong></p><p>We provide liquidity in several steps. These are a single phase where we provide the initial pool, and it’s corresponding liquidity position. We then start our liquidity drops over the course of three days. Finally, we perform some cleanup and then the token is tradable on the decentralized market.</p><h3>PHASE 1: INITIAL LIQUIDITY</h3><p>This initial pool allocation has a range from 0.10 to 10.00 USDC. This gives a maximum possible return of 100x, although we set the initial price to the presale price of 0.35 by adding 200190 USDC and 1M CMK. We set the fees at 1% to avoid excessive frontrunning.</p><p>The initial liquidity phase will undoubtedly be the most volatile 2 hours of the public launch. We expect the price to oscillate during this phase at the whims of the fickle puppeteers of hype, so to minimize the long term volatility, we will be overwhelming the initial liquidity in the first several hours with more targeted ranges.</p><h3>PHASE 2: LIQUIDITY DROPS</h3><p>Every 2 hours for 3 days, Credmark performs a Liquidity Drop of 250k CMK, for a total of 9M CMK. This releases all 10M CMK for the public distribution into the market.</p><p>A Liquidity Drop is performed in 2 steps.</p><p><strong>Liquidity Drop, Step one: The Swap</strong></p><p><br/>Credmark swaps 130k CMK for USDC from the position. This forces the price down, proportional to the liquidity that’s available in that price range.</p><p>For example, if the price of CMK is currently 1 USDC, and 130k CMK is representative of a small percentage of the total position value, it will force the price down. The proceeds from this swap are equivalent to the amount of liquidity from 1 to 0.97 USDC.</p><p>Credmark has now bought 130k CMK at 0.97 USDC minus the Uniswap Fee (1% of the swap value) for a total of around 125k USDC.</p><p>We have 120k CMK remaining from this drop’s initial 250k.</p><p>We’ve now added 130k more CMK to the circulating supply, increasing supply within the new range. How can we use these proceeds to add more liquidity to reinforce this price to reduce risk and incentivise accurate price discovery?</p><p><strong>Liquidity Drop, Step Two: New Position</strong></p><p>Credmark takes the USDC proceeds from the swap, and adds a new liquidity position with 120,000 CMK, extending the lower or upper bands equally, with the width set to slightly less than the previous band’s width. These widths start at ~14.2x, and decrease to ~2.5x.</p><p>In our example, we want to add a position of our remaining 120,000 CMK and the swap proceeds of 125k USDC. The price is 0.97 USDC, so we choose a width of 14.2x and center it around the current price, in this case our range is 0.25 -&gt; 3.28.</p><p>This will create price support, by supplying more liquidity centered around the new price, while also providing downward pressure in the form of the swap. The liquidity structure we end with will represent a curve supporting the discovered price during the three day period.</p><p>At the end of the three day launch period, we will have a liquidity curve that will look something like this, with strong price support in the center.</p><figure><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/9y1au457/production/134ae8ad92985c1fcd44a9823680443dde6fa198-1999x1215.jpg"/></figure><p>This curve stabilizes our token price around the peak of the curve, and enforces an economic correlation between the two assets.</p><p>After each Liquidity Drop there will be a small amount of USDC leftover. This can be used to mitigate frontrunning efforts, execute the cleanup phase, or fix rounding errors in future Liquidity Drops, at Credmark’s discretion.</p><h3>PHASE 3: CLEANUP</h3><p><br/>At the end of the three day period, we’ll be left with our initial liquidity position that allows for higher and lower prices than we want. So we’ll remove the initial 1M token position (now dwarfed by 9M CMK at another price) and create another 1M CMK liquidity position that allows for price movements somewhat beyond the curve at our discretion. This allows us to take a small amount of USDC proceeds from the position and reinforce the curve appropriately.</p><p>In the months following the launch, we shift the narrower, price irrelevant bands up and down, to keep them relevant to the project and improve capital efficiency, or use them to seed other DEXes, at our discretion.</p><h3>THE BENEFITS OF THIS METHOD</h3><h3>PRICE SUPPORT</h3><p>Since such a large percentage of the asset is available in the Uniswap position, this strategy creates a semi-stable asset with respect to USDC in the medium term. This is achieved in our case by strongly correlating our price with that of USDC. Since USDC is stable, it stabilizes the price of CMK.</p><p>This is appropriate for the first year of our token, since most early stage projects face internal disincentives from price up events, and demotivation from price down events. Both of these can be troublesome events for a blockchain project.</p><p>The price is more volatile at the edges of the liquidity curve than at the center. These price ranges may need to be adjusted with time, especially as the position generates long term fees, in order to prevent upward price pressure from breaking into less sustainable price ranges.</p><h3>PRICE DISCOVERY</h3><p>The reason that balancer LBPs are considered the gold-standard for price discovery is the downward pressure that the weight structure imposes over time. By swapping our liquidity and providing the proceeds back into the position, the downward pressure exists without the massive initial volatility downward, and reinforcing the narrowing price support each hour.<br/></p><h3>FRONT RUNNING MITIGATION</h3><p>Front running is discouraged in an LSD by</p><ul><li>stabilizing the price curve,</li><li>Uniswap’s swap limits, and</li><li>high fees for high frequency trading.</li></ul><p><em>For more information on front-running, see our <a href="https://www.credmark.com/blog/front-running-the-front-runners">blog post</a>.</em></p><h3>DISTRIBUTION</h3><p>This type of public launch is unknown, but it is expected to be similar to an LBP, due to similar price discovery and the long timeframe.</p><h3>TIMING</h3><p>Our Liquidity Swap Drop is set to start June 15th at Noon US/Central time and run for 72 hours. If you would like to participate, feel free to join our telegram or discord group to be part of the community, see live AMAs, and participate in virtual social events over the duration of the Launch.</p><h3></h3></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="simplebar-placeholder"></div></div><div class="simplebar-track simplebar-horizontal"><div class="simplebar-scrollbar"></div></div><div class="simplebar-track simplebar-vertical"><div class="simplebar-scrollbar"></div></div></div></main><div><div class="block m-auto"><div class="hidden sm:flex space-x-4 justify-center pb-1.5"><a class="pt-3.5 pl-20 text-xs" href="mailto:info@credmark.com" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"> info@credmark.com </a><a href="https://discord.com/invite/3dSfMqP3d4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><img width="25" src="../assets/discordsingle.png" alt="Discord logo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"/></a><a href="https://t.me/credmark" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><img width="25" src="../assets/telegram.png" alt="Telegram logo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"/></a><a href="https://twitter.com/credmarkhq " target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><img width="25" src="../assets/twitter.png" alt="Twitter logo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"/></a><p class="block m-auto text-center text-xs">© 2021 Credmark.
